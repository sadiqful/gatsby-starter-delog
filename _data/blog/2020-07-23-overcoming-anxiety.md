“Anxiety is love's greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic.” - Anais Nin

I recently read a book by Allan Ruffus titled The Master's sacred knowledge. I picked up a powerful qoute about life:

Knowing which move to make comes with insight and knowledge, and by learning the lessons that are accumulated along the way*.[](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/how-to-overcome-anxiety-190726150619/95/how-to-overcome-anxiety-4-638.jpg?cb=1564153627 "We often worry about a lot of things in life.

The book is story about a wise old Master who comes across a young man who was about to end his life by hanging himself to a large tree. The wise old Master asks the young man to spare him some of his time before he hangs himself. This the young man did and by doing so the wise old Master passed on a Sacred Master Key to him along with some of his Sacred Knowledge so he could open the doors to Divine Living.[](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/how-to-overcome-anxiety-190726150619/95/how-to-overcome-anxiety-4-638.jpg?cb=1564153627 "We often worry about a lot of things in life.

examp...")This shows how much many young people worry about a lot of things in life. Sometimes it may a financial condition, health, work, relationship or future. These problems are inevitable in life. 

Life is never complete. You will never have a complete life, you can't have it all. People are quick to mention the rich people but if you carefully study their lives, you will find something missing, it may even be a lack of inner peace or bad health condition. 

If you worry too much, it may affect your emotional stability and could even grow to anxiety. You will have a difficult time dealing with things and you will find yourself overthinking a lot, even about unnecessary things.

o...")Overcoming anxiety is not an instant process. It’s a part of you and you will have to take your time to heal and overcome it. Anxiety fluctuates, sometimes you think you over it and then boom, you will find yourself having anxiety again. Overthinking and over-analyzing things beyond thoughts. This is when things get messy. 

# **THE PROCESS**

**Acceptance** 

Accept and understand the fact that not every thought that you have is a reason to worry. Think of it as something harmless and try to ignore it instead of worrying and stressing over it. To overcome anxiety you can bring some exercises into practice.

**Questioning**

Stop irrelevant questioning. If it has to happen it will, no one can avoid it. When you question yourself unnecessarily you build up stress and fuel your anxiety. Learn to let it go sometimes.

Get out of your comfort zone. Instead of avoiding a certain situation or people, learn to face it all. Unless and until you do that you will never get rid of your anxiety. Go against your mind and follow your heart. There is no point of letting the fear control you. Just go with the flow and do whatever you want to do without self-doubt. No one is there to judge you and even if they do, ignore them.

**Medication**

Get the help of a doctor if your anxiety is getting worse. Proper medications and treatment will help you.

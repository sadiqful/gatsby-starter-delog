title: Finding your niche
metaDescription: How to find your niche
---
It's been over six months since the outbreak of the Corona Virus (Covid19), the global pandemic ravaging the world. People have lost their path, other people found their paths. However, for most people this is the best time to rediscover what they do, the pandemic has made people productive and unproductive. 

When you ask people what they have been doing to stay productive, it's either they have been following their path and working hard to make ends meet or they are just staying at home doing nothing. Some would even categorize watching movies as being productive. 

It is easier for people to discover their niche now. Although, for some people, it is the other way round. I strongly believe everyone is good at something. There are people who are multi-talented. An example, I am a software developer and have never had a passion for technical writing ever before. Today, I work as a Technical Writer. 

When you do something you are not passionate about for the first time, especially when you do it for pleasure sake, try as much as you can to gather feedback from people, they could help you discover your niche. 

Passion and interest are the driving force to discovering your niche and what you are good at. Analysing your interest and the things you are passionate about can help you discover what you want to do. Write down the things you are good at and filter them accordingly, by passion and interest. 

It should not surprise you, there are people who can't decipher what they are passionate about. They can't work out their interests. 

Ask people about the problems they are faced with, if you can work out a solution, that could be your niche. Look at the internet and the media, search for what people are asking for. An example, people on the internet are asking for a Shazam App-like for perfume. 

Before you come up with a solution, analyze the market and the competition. Are there solutions like this already? Are people willing to pay for your solution? What will you be doing differently? Is your solution efficient and proven to work?. When you finish making these analysis, you will find the right niche. 

Pick a niche and start something today. As long as you are consistent, as you grow your niche naturally transforms. You will begin to understand your true self and feedbacks from among your peers will go a long way.
